        <b><font size="5">Analytic covariance matrices for galaxy surveys</font></b><br/>
        I worked on a robust analytic method to compute the covariance matrix of galaxy redshift-space power spectrum. Our method is five orders of magnitude faster than traditional techniques which require simulating a large number of expensive mock simulations. We recently validated our analytic method using by using it to analyze the SDSS-BOSS survey data. We are now trying to generalize our technique to calculate covariance of redshift-space bispectrum, which is computationally intractable using mock simulations.

        <b><font size="5">Using neural networks to map dark matter to neutral hydrogen</font></b><br/>
        Upcoming 21cm surveys will map the spatial distribution of cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI) over very large cosmological volumes and we therefore need accurate theoretical predictions. Hydrodynamic simulations currently are the most accurate tool to provide those predictions but their computational cost is very high: tens of millions of CPU hours. I worked on using convolutional neural networks to quickly map the output from N-body simulations to HI from a hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our model performs better than the widely used theoretical model: Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) for all statistical properties up to the non-linear scales.

        <b><font size="5">Using astrophysical systems to constrain alternative dark matter models</font></b><br/>
         I worked on placing stringent bounds on popular dark matter models such as millicharged DM and hidden photon DM by using a dwarf galaxy called Leo T. We require that the heating/cooling due to DM interacting with gas in the Leo T not exceed the radiative cooling rate of the gas.
