        <b><font size="5">Analytic covariance matrices for galaxy surveys</font></b><br/>
In order to extract cosmological information from galaxy survey data, we typically use summary statistics such as the power spectrum and need an accurate estimate of their covariance matrix. The traditional techniques to obtain the covariance require simulating thousands of expensive mock simulations.
We developed a robust analytic method to compute the covariance matrix of galaxy redshift-space power spectrum which is more than four orders of magnitude faster. We recently validated our analytic method by using it to analyze the SDSS-BOSS survey data. I am now trying to generalize our technique to calculate covariance of redshift-space bispectrum, which is computationally prohibitive using mock simulations.

        <b><font size="5">Using neural networks to map dark matter to neutral hydrogen (and learn new physics)</font></b><br/>
        Upcoming 21cm surveys will map the spatial distribution of cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI) over very large cosmological volumes. Hydrodynamic simulations currently are the most accurate tool to provide accurate theoretical predictions for such surveys, but their computational cost is very high: tens of millions of CPU hours for small volumes. I worked on using convolutional neural networks to quickly map the output from N-body simulations to HI from a hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our model performs better than the widely used theoretical model: Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) for all statistical properties up to the non-linear scales.

        <b><font size="5">Using astrophysical systems to probe alternatives to cold, collisionless dark matter</font></b><br/>
         I worked on placing stringent bounds on popular dark matter models such as millicharged DM and hidden photon DM by using a dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way called Leo T. We required that the heating/cooling due to DM interacting with gas in the Leo T not exceed the radiative cooling rate of the gas.
